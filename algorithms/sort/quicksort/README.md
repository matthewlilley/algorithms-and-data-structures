# Quicksort

Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
